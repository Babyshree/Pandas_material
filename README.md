# Pandas_material

The "pandas_material" file appears to be a Python script containing code snippets that demonstrate various operations and functionalities of the Pandas library. Here's a description of what the file contains:

_**Data Manipulation:**_ The script shows how to create, manipulate, and analyze tabular data using Pandas DataFrames. Operations include creating DataFrames from dictionaries, accessing specific columns, filtering rows based on conditions, renaming columns, and performing basic statistical analysis.
_**Data Input/Output:**_ It demonstrates how to read data from CSV files using Pandas' read_csv() function and convert it into DataFrames for further analysis.
_**Basic DataFrame Operations:**_ The script illustrates basic DataFrame operations such as displaying the first few rows (head()) and last few rows (tail()), checking data types (dtypes), obtaining summary statistics (describe()), and getting information about the DataFrame (info()).
_**Data Analysis**:_ Various data analysis tasks are performed, including calculating mean, median, minimum, maximum, and skewness of numerical data in the DataFrame.
